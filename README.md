## Versioning

This library is versioned semantically.

* **Major versions** (e.g. 1.4.6 -> 2.0.0) represent significant shifts in functionality and may alter the call signatures of core features of the library. You may need to follow a migration plan to upgrade to a new major version.
* **Minor versions** (e.g. 1.4.6 -> 1.5.0) represent the removal or alteration of specific library features. They will not change core functionality, but the changelog should be reviewed before upgrading to avoid unexpected feature removals.
* **Patch versions** (e.g. 1.4.6 -> 1.4.7) represent internal improvements or new features that do not alter existing functionality or call signatures. They may introduce deprecations, but they will never remove deprecated functions. You can always safely upgrade to a new patch version.
