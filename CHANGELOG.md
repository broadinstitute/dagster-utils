# Changelog

All changes made between versions of this library are recorded here. Categorize changes as follows:

* **New features** are changes that add functionality, such as new optional arguments for existing functions or entire new classes/functions. These changes should never require that existing code be changed.
* **Bugfixes** are fairly self-explanatory - bugs that were identified and addressed. If fixing a bug required removing or altering existing features, make sure to list those under "breaking changes" as well.
* **Deprecations** are features that are still usable, but have been marked as deprecated (and thus trigger a warning when used). They are planned to be removed in a future version. Always try to deprecate functionality before it's removed.
* **Breaking changes** are changes that may break existing code using this library, such as renaming, removing, or reordering arguments to a function, deleting functionality (including deprecated functionality), or otherwise altering the library in ways that users will need to account for. Users should be able to use this section as a complete guide to upgrading their applications to be compatible with the new version.

For both deprecations and breaking changes, if there is an alternative way for users to accomplish something that they were using a deprecated/removed option for, list the alternative alongside the deprecation/change.
